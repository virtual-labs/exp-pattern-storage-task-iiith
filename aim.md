The objective in a pattern storage task is to store a given set of patterns, so that any of them can be recalled exactly, even when an approximate version of the corresponding pattern is presented to the network. Following are the goals of the experiment:
- To illustrate the state transition diagram of a Hopfield model.
- To understand and analyze pattern storage task using a 3-unit discrete Hopfield network model.
