- The chosen states which are within a Hamming distance of 1 can't be made stable states together.
- For states which can be made stable, there is a set of values of weights and thresholds that satisfies the corresponding inequalities sufficing which, the model always has chosen states as ones with minimum energy.
- The state transition diagram generated has positive probabilities to start from any state and end up in stable states.
