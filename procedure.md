- First choose 2 states which you intend to make as minimum energy states. Make sure of them being apart for a Hamming distance more than 1.
- Click on the two states and then click SUBMIT.
- Check out for the inequalities required to be satisfied with appropraite choice of weights and threshold values.
- Adjust the weights and threshold sliders \( w_{12}, w_{13}, w_{23}, \theta_{1}, \theta_{2}, \theta_{3}, \) with values in the range -1 and 1 to satisfy the inequalities.
- Click on DONE to submit, and then see how does the Hopfield model and energy transition diagram looks like.
- Move the mouse over the transition diagram to see the possible paths from higher energy state to lower energy states.
